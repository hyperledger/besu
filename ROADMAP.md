# Roadmap
This document represents the current working roadmap for Pantheon.  It is a living document, which will 
evolve and change over time.  In particular the features in later versions are likely to be refined and change.

We use the approach of  `#now`, `#next`, `#later` [used by foursquare](https://medium.com/@noah_weiss/now-next-later-roadmaps-without-the-drudgery-1cfe65656645), with a slightly different time horizon.  
Our now scale is about 3 months, next about 6 months, and then later is beyond.

## Now (up to v1.2)
Our key areas for now are:
* Privacy
* Smart Contract Based Permissioning
* First Class Client

### Advanced Privacy
The current privacy functionality will be enhanced as described in the [privacy roadmap](PRIVACYROADMAP.MD).

### Smart Contract Based Permissioning
Building on the smart contract based permissioning mechanism implemented in v1.1, additional tooling will be provided through a Dapp to simplify and enhance the interaction with the smart contracts. Permissioning for Ethereum accounts will also be introduced.

### Ethereum 1.x
The 1.x series of EIPs that are currently under early development will be implemented as they are ready.  In addition, the team will work on helping the specification of the Ethereum roadmap.

### State Pruning 

State pruning will be implemented. State pruning reduces the disk space required for the Pantheon database by discarding outdated world state data.

## Next
The key areas for next are:
* Secure key-store and key management
* Disaster Recovery
* Permissioning governance
* IBFT 2.x 

## Future
In addition to making incremental improvements to the above features, there will be some bigger pieces of work.  
These are deliberately kept vague at this time, and will be elaborated upon when they move up to the now and next levels of work.
* Ethereum 2.0
* Alternate Consensus Mechanisms
* Sidechains
