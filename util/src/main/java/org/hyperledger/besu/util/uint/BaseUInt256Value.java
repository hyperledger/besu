/**
 * Base class for {@link UInt256Value}.
 *
 * <p>This class is abstract as it is not meant to be used directly, but it has no abstract methods.
 * As mentioned in {@link UInt256Value}, this is used to create strongly-typed type aliases of
 * {@link UInt256}. In other words, this allow to "tag" numbers with the unit of what they represent
 * for the type-system, which can help clarity, but also forbid mixing numbers that are mean to be
 * of different units (the strongly type part).
 *
 * <p>This class implements {@link UInt256Value}, but also add a few operations that take a {@link
 * UInt256} directly, for instance {@link #times(UInt256)}. The rational is that multiplying a given
 * quantity of something by a "raw" number is always meaningful, and return a new quantity of the
 * same thing.
 *
 * @param <T> The concrete type of the value.
