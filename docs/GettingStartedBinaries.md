# Getting Started with Pantheon

After you download and unpackage Pantheon, display the command line help to confirm installation:

1. At the command line, change into the `pantheon-<release>` directory. 

2. To display the command line help:
    ```
    ./bin/pantheon --help
   ```

[Starting Pantheon](https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/stable/Getting-Started/Starting-Pantheon/) includes
command line examples for connecting to MainNet, public testnets, and running a node for testing. 

Pantheon documentation is on the [Pantheon documentation site](https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/stable/). 

>**Note** Starting Pantheon by double-clicking the `pantheon` or `pantheon.bat` executables starts a node synchronizing with the Ethereum mainnet.
