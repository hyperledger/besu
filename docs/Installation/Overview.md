# Installation Overview

You can install Pantheon by:

* [Installing the binary distribution](Install-Binaries.md) 
* [Building from source](Build-From-Source.md) 

!!! note 
    To run a single node to connect the Ethereum mainnet or a public testnet, running from the [Pantheon docker image](../Getting-Started/Run-Docker-Image.md) is the fastest way to get started.

## Disk Space and RAM Requirements
Your computer should have at least 4 GB RAM if running a private network, and 8GB of RAM if running mainnet or a public test network. 

Disk space needed varies depending on the network on which you run nodes. A small test network might require 200 MB while a mainnet node might require 1.5TB. If syncing a node on mainnet, allow 1.5 TB to 2 TB for the full blockchain archive.
