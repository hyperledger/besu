/**
 * Manages access events that are done to the stateless AccessWitness. An access mode is passed to
 * the witness representing the type of access being done on the verkle trie leaf node: read, write
 * to an existing leaf (reset) or write to a non-existent leaf (set). The access mode is then
 * evaluated against structures that track previous access events, to avoid double charging of a
 * warm account or slot. What results is the **new** access event schedule that is then used for gas
 * charging.
 *
 * <p>This class can represent a leaf or a branch access event. Each leaf access event has a
 * reference to its corresponding branch event, so that accesses to leaves and branches can be
 * reverted synchronously.
