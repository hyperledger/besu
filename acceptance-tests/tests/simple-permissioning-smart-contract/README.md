## Pre-requisites
* [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com/) installed 
```
npm install -g truffle
```
* [Wallet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/truffle-hdwallet-provider) installed
```
npm install truffle-hdwallet-provider
```
## To run the tests:
```
cd acceptance-tests/simple-permissioning-smart-contract
```
* here you will find truffle.js which has network configurations for 
  * development (Ganache) and 
  * devwallet (points to localhost:8545)
  * Note you need Ganache running if you want to run the tests against it (see below)
  * Also this truffle.js uses address and private key generated by Ganache with default mnemonic "candy maple cake sugar pudding cream honey rich smooth crumble sweet treat"

* To run the Truffle example with Besu, you need Besu running  
  * [check out and build Besu](../../README.md)
  * run Besu (either in IDE or via command line), with mining and RPC enabled.

* Run Truffle migrate against Ganache
```
truffle migrate 
```
* Output should look something like:
```
Compiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol...
Compiling ./contracts/SimplePermissioning.sol...
Writing artifacts to ./build/contracts

⚠️  Important ⚠️
If you're using an HDWalletProvider, it must be Web3 1.0 enabled or your migration will hang.

If migrate works, try running the tests

```
cd acceptance-tests/simple-permissioning-smart-contract
truffle test 
```
* Output should look something like:
```

##Permissioning Contract Updating Steps
Should these contracts require updating, please ensure that the compiled bytecode in the Permissioning acceptance tests genesis file has been updated with the new bytecode.

One simple update procedure is as follows:
1. Load existing contract in [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Enable the _"SOLIDITY COMPILER"_ plugin.
3. Make required changes.
4. Compile contract (_"Enable optimization"_ disabled.)
5. Click the _"Compilation Details"_ button.
6. Navigate to the _"RUNTIME BYTECODE"_ section and copy the value for the _"object"_ key.
7. Paste this text as the value for the _"code"_ key in the relevant genesis file.
