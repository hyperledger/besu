# Technical Charter (the "Charter") for Besu a Series of LF Projects, LLC

**Amended June \_\_, 2025**

This Charter sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the Besu open source project, which has been established as Besu a Series of LF Projects, LLC (the "Project").  LF Projects, LLC ("LF Projects") is a Delaware series limited liability company. All contributors (including committers, maintainers, and other technical positions) and other participants in the Project (collectively, "Collaborators") must comply with the terms of this Charter.

1. **Mission and Scope of the Project**

      1. The mission of the Project is to develop an Ethereum execution client.

      2. The scope of the Project includes collaborative development under the Project License (as defined herein) supporting the mission, including documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the open source project.

2. **Maintainer Oversight**

      1. The maintainers of the project (collectively, the "Maintainers")  will be responsible for all technical oversight of the open source Project.

      2. At the inception of the project and going forward, the Maintainers of the Project will be as set forth within the "MAINTAINERS" file within the Project's code repository. The Maintainers may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the Project (such as the establishment of a technical steering committee for project technical oversight), and any such alternative approach will be documented in the MAINTAINERS file.  Any meetings of the Maintainers are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person.

      3. Sub-projects generally will involve Contributors and Maintainers. The Maintainers  may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in the MAINTAINERS file. Unless otherwise documented:

         1. Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the Project;

         2. Maintainers are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify ("commit") source code, documentation or other technical artifacts in a project's repository; and  

         3. A Contributor may become a Maintainer by a majority approval of the existing Maintainers. A Maintainer may be removed by a majority approval of the other existing Maintainers.

      4. Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and Maintainer is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of this Charter.

      5. The Maintainers may (1) establish work flow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of sub-projects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Maintainer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Maintainers, and create new roles, and publicly document any technical roles, as it sees fit.

      6. The Maintainers may elect a Chair, who will preside over meetings of the Maintainers and will serve until their resignation or replacement by the Maintainers.  The Chair, or any other Maintainer so designated by the Maintainers, will serve as the primary communication contact between the Project and LF Decentralized Trust, a directed fund of The Linux Foundation.

      7. Responsibilities: The Maintainers will be responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Project, which may include:

         1. coordinating the technical direction of the Project;

         2. approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to, archiving and changing a sub-project's scope);

         3. organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects;

         4. creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements;

         5. appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities;

         6. establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies;

         7. approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing (to be published in the CONTRIBUTING file) and coordinating with the series manager of the Project (as provided for in the Series Agreement, the "Series Manager") to resolve matters or concerns that may arise as set forth in Section 7 of this Charter;

         8. discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple projects; and

         9. coordinating communications regarding the Project.

3. **Voting**

   1. While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any  decision of the Maintainers requires a vote to move the Project forward, the voting members of the Maintainers will vote on a one vote per voting member basis.

   2. It is anticipated that most decisions will be made asynchronously, but meetings of Maintainers may be held.  Quorum for such meetings requires at least fifty percent of all Maintainers to be present. Meetings of Maintainers may continue if quorum is not met but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.

   3. Except as provided in Section 7.c. and 8.a, decisions by vote at a meeting require a majority vote of those in attendance, provided quorum is met. Decisions made asynchronously by electronic vote without a meeting require a majority vote of the Maintainers.

   4. In the event a vote cannot be resolved by the Maintainers, any Maintainer may refer the matter to the Series Manager for assistance in reaching a resolution.

4. **Compliance with Policies**

   1. This Charter is subject to the Series Agreement for the Project and the Operating Agreement of LF Projects. Contributors will comply with the policies of LF Projects as currently adopted by LF Projects, including the policies listed at [https://lfprojects.org/policies/](https://lfprojects.org/policies/).  

   2. The Maintainers may adopt a code of conduct ("CoC") for the Project, which is subject to approval by the Series Manager.  In the event that a Project-specific CoC has not been approved, the LF Projects Code of Conduct listed at [https://lfprojects.org/policies](https://lfprojects.org/policies) will apply for all Collaborators in the Project.

   3. When amending or adopting any policy applicable to the Project, LF Projects will publish such policy, as to be amended or adopted, on its web site at least 30 days prior to such policy taking effect; provided, however, that in the case of any amendment of the Trademark Policy or Terms of Use of LF Projects, any such amendment is effective upon publication on LF Project's web site.

   4. All Collaborators must allow open participation from any individual or organization meeting the requirements for contributing under this Charter and any policies adopted for all Collaborators by the Maintainers, regardless of competitive interests. Put another way, the Project community must not seek to exclude any participant based on any criteria, requirement, or reason other than those that are reasonable and applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all Collaborators in the Project community.

   5. The Project will operate in a transparent, open, collaborative, and ethical manner at all times. The output of all Project discussions, proposals, timelines, decisions, and status should be made open and easily visible to all. Any potential violations of this requirement should be reported immediately to the Series Manager.

5. Community Assets
