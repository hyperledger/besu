  ## Code Review

  - Focus on bugs, security issues, and correctness. Do not flag style nits.
  - Do not suggest adding comments, javadocs, or type annotations to unchanged code.
  - Do not flag naming conventions unless they cause confusion.
  - Only flag issues that would affect functionality or maintainability.
