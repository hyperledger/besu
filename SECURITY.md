# Hyperledger Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Bug

If you think you have discovered a security issue in any of the Hyperledger projects, we'd love to
hear from you. We will take all security bugs seriously and if confirmed upon investigation we will
patch it within a reasonable amount of time and release a public security bulletin discussing the
impact and credit the discoverer.

There are two email addresses where Hyperledger Besu accepts security bugs. The
first, [security "dash" besu at lists dot hyperledger dot org](mailto:security-besu@lists.hyperledger.org)
is limited to a subset of Hyperledger Besu maintainers and Hyperledger staff. For highly sensitive
bugs this is a preferred address. The second email
address [security at hyperledger dot org](mailto:security@hyperledger.org) is limited to a subset of
maintainers and staff of all Hyperledger projects, and may be viewed by maintainers outside of
Hyperledger Besu. When sending information to either of these emails please be sure to include a
description of the flaw and any related information (e.g. reproduction steps, version, known active
use).

The process by which the Hyperledger Security Team handles security bugs is documented further in
our [Defect Response page](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/SEC/Defect+Response) on our
[wiki](https://wiki.hyperledger.org).
