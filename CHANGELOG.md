# Changelog

## 22.7.3

### Additions and Improvements
- Allow free gas networks in the London fee market [#4061](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/4061)
- Upgrade besu-native to 0.6.0 and use Blake2bf native implementation if available by default [#4264](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/4264)

### Bug Fixes


## 22.7.2
### Besu 22.7.2 is a recommended release for the Merge and Mainnet users. 22.7.1 remains Merge-ready. This release provides additional robustness before the Merge with some fixes and improvements in sync, peering, and logging.

### Additions and Improvements
- Better management of jemalloc presence/absence in startup script [#4237](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/4237)
- Retry mechanism when getting a broadcasted block fail on all peers [#4271](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/4271)
- Filter out disconnected peers when fetching available peers [#4269](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/4269)
- Updated the default value of fast-sync-min-peers post merge [#4298](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/4298)
- Log imported block info post merge [#4310](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/4310)
- Transaction pool eviction by sender from tail of transaction list [#4327](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/4327)
- Transaction pool sender future nonce limits [#4336](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/4336)
- Pandas! Pandas now appear in 3 phases: The black bear and polar bear that are preparing? Those will appear when
your client has TTD configured (which is setup by default for mainnet), is in sync, and processing Proof of Work blocks. In the second phase you will see them powering up when the Terminal Total Difficulty block is added to the blockchain.
The final form of the Ethereum Panda will appear when the first finalized block is received from the Consensus Layer.

### Bug Fixes
- Accept wit/80 from Nethermind [#4279](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/4279)
- Properly shutdown the miner executor, to avoid waiting 30 seconds when stopping [#4353](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/4353)

### Early Access Features
- QBFT is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm, building on the capabilities of IBFT and IBFT 2.0. It aims to provide performance improvements in cases of excess round change, and provides interoperability with other EEA compliant clients, such as GoQuorum.
  - Note: QBFT currently only supports new networks. Existing networks using IBFT2.0 cannot migrate to QBFT. This will become available in a future release.
  - Note: QBFT is an early access feature pending community feedback. Please make use of QBFT in new development networks and reach out in case of issues or concerns
- GoQuorum-compatible privacy. This mode uses Tessera and is interoperable with GoQuorum.
  - Note: GoQuorum-compatible privacy is an early access feature pending community feedback.

## 21.1.0

### Important note: this release contains an outdated version of the Berlin network upgrade, which was changed on March 5, 2021 ([link](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/263#issuecomment-791473406)). If you are using Besu on public Ethereum networks, you must upgrade to 21.1.2.

## 21.1.0 Features

Features added between 20.10.0 to 21.1.0 include:
* Berlin Network Upgrade: this release contains the activation blocks for Berlin across all supported testnets and the Ethereum mainnet. They are:
  * Ropsten 9_812_189 (10 Mar 2021)
  * Goerli 4_460_644 (17 Mar 2021)
  * Rinkeby 8_290_928 (24 Mar 2021)
  * Ethereum 12_244_000 (14 Apr 2021)
* Besu Launcher: Besu now has support for the [Quorum Mainnet Launcher](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-mainnet-launcher) which makes it easy for users to configure and launch Besu on the Ethereum mainnet.
* Bonsai Tries: A new database format which reduces storage requirements and improves performance for access to recent state. _Note: only full sync is currently supported._
* Miner Data JSON-RPC: The `eth_getMinerDataByBlockHash` and `eth_getMinerDataByBlockNumber` endpoints return miner rewards and coinbase address for a given block.
* EIP-1898 support: [The EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1898) adds `blockHash` to JSON-RPC methods which accept a default block parameter.

### Early Access Features
* Bonsai Tries: A new database format which reduces storage requirements and improves performance for access to recent state. _Note: only full sync is currently supported._
* QBFT: A new consensus algorithm to support interoperability with other Enterprise Ethereum Alliance compatible clients.

### 21.1.0 Breaking Changes
* `--skip-pow-validation-enabled` is now an error with `block import --format JSON`. This is because the JSON format doesn't include the nonce so the proof of work must be calculated.
* `eth_call` will not return a JSON-RPC result if the call fails, but will return an error instead. If it was for a revert the revert reason will be included.
* `eth_call` will not fail for account balance issues by default. An parameter `"strict": true` can be added to the call parameters (with `to` and `from`) to enforce balance checks.

### Additions and Improvements
* Added `besu_transaction_pool_transactions` to the reported metrics, counting the mempool size [\#1869](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1869)
* Added activation blocks for Berlin Network Upgrade [\#1929](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1929)

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed representation of access list for access list transactions in JSON-RPC results.

## 21.1.0-RC2
### Additions and Improvements
* Support for the Berlin Network Upgrade, although the block number must be set manually with `--override-genesis-config=berlinBlock=<blocknumber>`. This is because the block numbers haven't been determined yet. The next release will include the number in the genesis file so it will support Berlin with no intervention. [\#1898](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1898)

## 21.1.0-RC1

### 21.1.0 Breaking Changes
* `--skip-pow-validation-enabled` is now an error with `block import --format JSON`. This is because the JSON format doesn't include the nonce so the proof of work must be calculated.
* `eth_call` will not return a JSON-RPC result if the call fails, but will return an error instead. If it was for a revert the revert reason will be included.
* `eth_call` will not fail for account balance issues by default. An parameter `"strict": true` can be added to the call parameters (with `to` and `from`) to enforce balance checks.

### Additions and Improvements
* Removed unused flags in default genesis configs [\#1812](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1812)
* `--skip-pow-validation-enabled` is now an error with `block import --format JSON`. This is because the JSON format doesn't include the nonce so the proof of work must be calculated. [\#1815](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1815)
* Added a new CLI option `--Xlauncher` to start a mainnet launcher. It will help to configure Besu easily.
* Return the revert reason from `eth_call` JSON-RPC api calls when the contract causes a revert. [\#1829](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1829)
* Added `chainId`, `publicKey`, and `raw` to JSON-RPC api calls returning detailed transaction results. [\#1835](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1835)

### Bug Fixes
* Ethereum classic heights will no longer be reported in mainnet metrics. Issue [\#1751](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1751) Fix [\#1820](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1820)
* Don't enforce balance checks in `eth_call` unless explicitly requested. Issue [\#502](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/502) Fix [\#1834](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1834)

## 20.10.1

### Additions and Improvements
* `--random-peer-priority-enabled` flag added. Allows for incoming connections to be prioritized randomly. This will prevent (typically small, stable) networks from forming impenetrable peer cliques. [#1440](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1440)
* `miner_changeTargetGasLimit` RPC added. If a target gas limit is set, allows the node operator to change it at runtime.
* Hide deprecated `--host-whitelist` option. [\#1444](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1444)
* Prioritize high gas prices during mining. Previously we ordered only by the order in which the transactions were received. This will increase expected profit when mining. [\#1449](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1449)
* Added support for the updated smart contract-based [node permissioning EEA interface](https://entethalliance.github.io/client-spec/spec.html#dfn-connectionallowed). [\#1435](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1435) and [\#1496](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1496)
* Added EvmTool binary to the distribution.  EvmTool is a CLI that can execute EVM bytecode and execute ethereum state tests. [\#1465](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1465)
* Updated the libraries for secp256k1 and AltBN series precompiles. These updates provide significant performance improvements to those areas. [\#1499](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1499)
* Provide MegaGas/second measurements in the log when doing a full block import, such as the catch up phase of a fast sync. [\#1512](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1512)
* Added new endpoints to get miner data, `eth_getMinerDataByBlockHash` and `eth_getMinerDataByBlockNumber`. [\#1538](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1538)
* Added direct support for OpenTelemetry metrics [\#1492](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1492)
* Added support for `qip714block` config parameter in genesis file, paving the way towards permissioning interoperability between Besu and GoQuorum. [\#1545](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1545)
* Added new CLI option `--compatibility-eth64-forkid-enabled`. [\#1542](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1542)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix a bug on `eth_estimateGas` which returned `Internal error` instead of `Execution reverted` in case of reverted transaction. [\#1478](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1478)
* Fixed a bug where Local Account Permissioning was being incorrectly enforced on block import/validation. [\#1510](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1510)
* Fixed invalid enode URL when discovery is disabled  [\#1521](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1521)
* Removed duplicate files from zip and tar.gz distributions. [\#1566](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1566)
* Add a more rational value to eth_gasPrice, based on a configurable percentile of prior block's transactions (default: median of last 100 blocks).  [\#1563](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1563)

## Deprecated

### --privacy-precompiled-address (Scheduled for removal in _Next_ Release)
Deprecated in 1.5.1
- CLI option `--privacy-precompiled-address` option removed. This address is now derived, based	on `--privacy-onchain-groups-enabled`. [\#1222](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1222)

### Besu Sample Network repository

The [Besu Sample Networks repository](https://github.com/ConsenSys/besu-sample-networks) has been replaced by the [Quorum Developer Quickstart](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Tutorials/Developer-Quickstart).

## 20.10.0

## Release format

Hyperledger Besu is moving its versioning scheme to [CalVer](https://calver.org/) starting with the 20.10.0 (formerly 1.6.0) release. More information about the specific version of CalVer Besu is using can be found on the [wiki](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Using+CalVer+for+Besu+Releases).

## 20.10 Breaking Changes

When upgrading to 20.10, ensure you've taken into account the following breaking changes.

### JSON-RPC HTTP Error Codes For Valid Calls ([\#1426](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1426))

Prior versions of Besu would set the HTTP Status 400 Bad Request for JSON-RPC requests that completed in an error, regardless of the kind of error.  These responses could include a complete JSON-RPC response with an error field.

In Besu version 20.10, properly formatted requests that have valid parameters (count and content) will return a HTTP Status 200 OK, with an error field if an error occurred. For example, requesting an account that does not exist in the chain, or a block by hash that Besu does not have, will now return HTTP 200 OK responses. Unparsable requests, improperly formatted requests, or requests with invalid parameters will continue to return HTTP 400 Bad Request.

Users of Web3J should note that many calls will now return a result with the error field containing the message whereas before a call would throw an exception with the error message as the exception message.

## 20.10.0 Additions and Improvements

* Added support for ECIP-1099 / Classic Thanos Fork: Calibrate Epoch Duration. [\#1421](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1421) [\#1441](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1441) [\#1462](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1462)
* Added the Open Telemetry Java agent to report traces to a remote backend. Added an example to showcase the trace reporting capabilities.
* Added EvmTool binary to the distribution.  EvmTool is a CLI that can execute EVM bytecode and execute ethereum state tests. Documentation for it is available [here](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Troubleshoot/Use-EVM-Tool/). [\#1465](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1465)
* Added support for the upcoming YOLOv2 ephemeral testnet and removed the flag for the deprecated YOLOv1 ephemeral testnet. [#1386](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1386)
* Added `debug_standardTraceBlockToFile` JSON-RPC API. This API accepts a block hash and will replay the block. It returns a list of files containing the result of the trace (one file per transaction). [\#1392](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1392)
* Added `debug_standardTraceBadBlockToFile` JSON-RPC API. This API is similar to `debug_standardTraceBlockToFile`, but can be used to obtain info about a block which has been rejected as invalid. [\#1403](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1403)
* Added support for EIP-2929 to YOLOv2. [#1387](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1387)
* Added `--start-block` and `--end-block` to the `blocks import` subcommand [\#1399](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1399)
* Added support for multi-tenancy when using the early access feature of [onchain privacy group management](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Privacy/Onchain-PrivacyGroups/)
* \[Reverted\] Fixed memory leak in eth/65 subprotocol behavior. It is now enabled by default. [\#1420](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1420), [#1348](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1348), [#1321](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1321)

### Bug Fixes

* Log block import rejection reasons at "INFO" level.  Bug [#1412](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/1412)
* Fixed NPE when executing `eth_estimateGas` with privacy enabled.  Bug [#1404](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/1404)

### Breaking Change to Onchain Privacy Group Management

This [early access feature](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Privacy/Onchain-PrivacyGroups/) was changed in a way that makes onchain privacy groups created with previous versions no longer usable.

To enhance control over permissions on the privacy group management contract:

* The enclave key was removed as the first parameter for `addParticipant` and `removeParticipant`.
* The owner of the privacy group management contract is the signer of the private transaction that creates
  the privacy group. In the default onchain privacy group management contract implementation, only the
  owner can add and remove participants, and upgrade the management contract.

The onchain privacy support in the current version of the web3js-eea library (v0.9) will not be compatible with Besu v1.5.3.  We are actively working on an upgrade to webj3-eea that will support these changes.

## 1.5.2

### Additions and Improvements

* Experimental offline backup and restore has been added via the `operator x-backup-state` and `operator x-restore-state` CLI commands.  Data formats will be fluid for as long as the `x-` prefix is present in the CLI so it is advised not to rely on these backups for disaster recovery. [\#1235](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1235)
* Experimental ethstats support added via the `Xethstats` and `Xethstats-contact` CLI commands. [\#1239](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1239)
* Peers added via the JSON-RPC `admin_addPeer` and `admin_removePeer` will be shared or no longer shared via discovery respectively.  Previously they were not shared. [\#1177](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1177) contributed by [br0tchain](https://github.com/br0tchain).
* New Docker Images (see below). [\#1277](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1277)
* Reworked static peer discovery handling. [\#1292](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1292)

### New Java VMs in Docker Image

* New docker images are being generated to use the latest version of OpenJDK (currently 14.0.1) with the tag suffix of `-openjdk-latest`, for example `1.5.2-openjdk-latest`.
* New docker images are being generated to use [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) with the tag suffix of `-graalvm`, for example `1.5.2-graalvm`.
* The existing images based on Java 11 are also being tagged with the suffix `-openjdk-11`, for example `1.5.2-openjdk-11`, as well as `1.5.2`.

The intent is that the major Java VM version or Java VM type shipped with the default docker images (`latest`, `1.5.x`, etc.) may be changed during future quarterly releases but will remain consistent within quarterly releases.

### Bug Fixes
- Offchain permissioning - fixed bug where sync status check prevented peering if static nodes configured. [\#1252](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/1252)

- GraphQL queries of `miner` in IBFT networks will no longer return an error.  PR [\#1282](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1282) issue [\#1272](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/1272).

## 1.5.1

### Deprecated
- CLI option `--privacy-precompiled-address` option is deprecated. This address is now derived, based
on `--privacy-onchain-groups-enabled`. [\#1222](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1222)

### Additions and Improvements

* In an IBFT2 network, a fixed block reward value and recipient address can be defined in genesis file [\#1132](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1132)
* JSON-RPC HTTP API Authorization: exit early when checking user permissions. [\#1144](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1144)

## 1.5 Breaking changes

When upgrading to 1.5, ensure you've taken into account the following breaking changes.

### Docker users with volume mounts

To maintain best security practices, we're changing the `user:group` on the Docker container to `besu`.

What this means for you:

* If you are running Besu as a binary, there is no impact.
* If you are running Besu as a Docker container *and* have a volume mount for data,  ensure that the
permissions on the directory allow other users and groups to r/w. Ideally this should be set to
`besu:besu` as the owner.

Note that the `besu` user only exists within the container not outside it. The same user ID may match
a different user outside the image.

If you’re mounting local folders, it is best to set the user via the Docker `—user` argument. Use the
UID because the username may not exist inside the docker container. Ensure the directory being mounted
is owned by that user.

### Remove Manual NAT method

The NAT manager `MANUAL` method has been removed.
If you have been using the `MANUAL` method, use the `NONE` method instead. The behavior of the
`NONE` method is the same as the previously supported `MANUAL` methods.

### Privacy users

Besu minor version upgrades require upgrading Orion to the latest minor version. That is, for
Besu <> Orion node pairs, when upgrading Besu to v1.5, it is required that Orion is upgraded to
v1.6. Older versions of Orion will no longer work with Besu v1.5.

## 1.5 Features

Features added between from 1.4 to 1.5 include:
* Mining Support
  Besu supports `eth_hashrate` and `eth_submitHashrate` to obtain the hashrate when we mine with a GPU mining worker.
* Tracing
  The [Tracing API](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/API-Methods/#trace-methods) is no longer an Early Access feature and now has full support for `trace_replayBlockTransactions`, `trace_Block` and `trace_transaction`.
* Plugin API Block Events
  `BlockAdded` and `BlockReorg` are now exposed via the [Plugin API](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.hyperledger.besu/plugin-api/latest/org/hyperledger/besu/plugin/services/BesuEvents.html).
* [Filters](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Interact/Filters/Accessing-Logs-Using-JSON-RPC/) and
  [subscriptions](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Interact/APIs/RPC-PubSub/) for private contracts.
* [SecurityModule Plugin API](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.hyperledger.besu/plugin-api/latest/org/hyperledger/besu/plugin/services/SecurityModuleService.html)
  This allows use of a different [security module](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#security-module)
  as a plugin to provide cryptographic function that can be used by NodeKey (such as sign, ECDHKeyAgreement etc.).
* [Onchain privacy groups](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Concepts/Privacy/Onchain-PrivacyGroups/)
  with add and remove members. This is an early access feature. Early access features are not recommended
  for production networks and may have unstable interfaces.

## 1.5 Additions and Improvements

* Public Networks Default to Fast Sync: The default sync mode for named permissionless networks, such as the Ethereum mainnet and testnets, is now `FAST`.
  * The default is unchanged for private networks. That is, the sync mode defaults to `FULL` for private networks.
  * Use the [`--sync-mode` command line option](https://besu.hyperledger.org/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#sync-mode) to change the sync mode. [\#384](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/384)
* Proper Mining Support: Added full support for `eth_hashrate` and `eth_submitHashrate`. It is now possible to have the hashrate when we mine with a GPU mining worker [\#1063](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1063)
* Performance Improvements: The addition of native libraries ([\#775](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/775)) and changes to data structures in the EVM ([\#1089](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1089)) have improved Besu sync and EVM execution times.
* Tracing API Improvements: The [Tracing API](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/API-Methods/#trace-methods) is no longer an Early Access feature and now has full support for `trace_replayBlockTransactions`, `trace_Block` and `trace_transaction`.
* New Plugin API Block Events: `BlockAdded` and `BlockReorg` are now exposed via the Plugin API [\#637](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/637).
* Added experimental CLI option `--Xnat-kube-pod-name` to specify the name of the loadbalancer used by the Kubernetes nat manager [\#1078](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1078)
- Local permissioning TOML config now supports additional keys (`nodes-allowlist` and `accounts-allowlist`).
Support for `nodes-whitelist` and `accounts-whitelist` will be removed in a future release.
- Add missing `mixHash` field for `eth_getBlockBy*` JSON RPC endpoints. [\#1098](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1098)
* Besu now has a strict check on private transactions to ensure the privateFrom in the transaction
matches the sender Orion key that has distributed the payload. Besu 1.5+ requires Orion 1.6+ to work.

### Bug fixes

No bug fixes with [user impact in this release](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Changelog).

### Known Issues

Known issues are open issues categorized as [Very High or High impact](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Defect+Prioritisation+Policy).

#### New known issues

- K8S permissioning uses of Service IPs rather than pod IPs which can fail. [\#1190](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1190)
Workaround - Do not use permissioning on K8S.

- Restart caused by insufficient memory can cause inconsistent private state. [\#1110](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1110)
Workaround - Ensure you allocate enough memory for the Java Runtime Environment that the node does not run out of memory.

### Additions and Improvements

- Implemented WebSocket logs subscription for private contracts (`priv_subscribe`/`priv_unsubscribe`) [\#762](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/762)
- Introduced SecurityModule plugin API. This allows use of a different security module as a plugin to
  provide cryptographic function that can be used by NodeKey (such as sign, ECDHKeyAgreement etc.). KeyPairSecurityModule
  is registered and used by default. The CLI option `--security-module=<name> (defaults to localfile)` can be used
  to identify the security module plugin name to use instead. [\#713](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/713)
- Several testing related changes to improve compatibility with [Hive](https://hivetests.ethdevops.io/) and Retesteth.

## 1.4.3

### Issues identified with 1.4.3 release

The `eth/65` change is not [backwards compatible](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/723).
This has the following impact:
* In a private network, nodes using the 1.4.3 client cannot interact with nodes using 1.4.2 or earlier
clients.
* On mainnet, synchronizing eventually stalls.

Workaround -> revert to v1.4.2.

A [fix](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/732) is currently [being tested](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/733).

### Critical Issue for Privacy Users

A critical issue for privacy users with private transactions created using Hyperledger Besu v1.3.4
or earlier has been identified. If you have a network with private transaction created using v1.3.4
or earlier, please read the following and take the appropriate steps:
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Critical+Issue+for+Privacy+Users

### Additions and Improvements

- Added `eth/65` support. [\#608](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/608)
- Added block added and block reorg events. Added revert reason to block added transactions. [\#637](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/637)

### Deprecated

- Private Transaction `hash` field and `getHash()` method have been deprecated. They will be removed
in 1.5.0 release. [\#639](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/639)

### Known Issues

#### Fast sync when running Besu on cloud providers

A known [RocksDB issue](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/6435) causes fast sync to fail
when running Besu on certain cloud providers. The following error is displayed repeatedly:

```
...
EthScheduler-Services-1 (importBlock) | ERROR | PipelineChainDownloader | Chain download failed. Restarting after short delay.
java.util.concurrent.CompletionException: org.hyperledger.besu.plugin.services.exception.StorageException: org.rocksdb.RocksDBException: block checksum mismatch:
....
```

This behaviour has been seen on AWS and Digital Ocean.

Workaround -> On AWS, a full restart of the AWS VM is required to restart the fast sync.

Fast sync is not currently supported on Digital Ocean. We are investigating options to
[add support for fast sync on Digital Ocean](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/591).

#### Error full syncing with pruning

- Error syncing with mainnet on Besu 1.3.7 node - MerkleTrieException [\#580](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/580)
The associated error is `Unable to load trie node value for hash` and is caused by the combination of
full sync and pruning.

Workarounds:
1. Explicitly disable pruning using `--pruning-enabled=false` when using fast sync.
2. If the `MerkleTrieException` occurs, delete the database and resync.

A fix for this issue is being actively worked on.

#### Fast sync reverting to full sync

In some cases of FastSyncException, fast sync reverts back to a full sync before having reached the
pivot block. [\#683](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/683)

Workaround -> To re-attempt fast syncing rather than continue full syncing, stop Besu, delete your
database, and start again.

#### Bootnodes must be validators when using onchain permissioning

- Onchain permissioning nodes can't peer when using a non-validator bootnode [\#528](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/528)

Workaround -> When using onchain permissioning, ensure bootnodes are also validators.


## 1.4.2

### Additions and Improvements

- Added `trace_block` JSON RPC API [\#449](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/449)
- Added `pulledStates` and `knownStates` to the EthQL `syncing` query and `eth_syncing` JSON-RPC api [\#565](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/565)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed file parsing behaviour for privacy enclave keystore password file [\#554](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/554) (thanks to [magooster](https://github.com/magooster))
- Fixed known issue with being unable to re-add members to onchain privacy groups [\#471](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/471)

### Updated Early Access Features

* [Onchain privacy groups](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Concepts/Privacy/Onchain-PrivacyGroups/) with add and remove members. Known issue resolved (see above).
* [TRACE API](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/API-Methods/#trace-methods) now includes `trace_block`, `trace_replayBlockTransactions`, and `trace_transaction`.
Fixed some issues on the trace replay block transactions API [\#522](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/522).

### Known Issues

#### Fast sync defaulting to full sync

-  When fast sync cannot find enough valid peers rapidly enough, Besu defaults to full sync.

Workarounds:
1. To re-attempt fast syncing rather than continue full syncing, stop Besu, delete your database,
and start again.
2. When fast syncing, explicitly disable pruning using `--pruning-enabled=false` to reduce the likelihood
of encountering the pruning bug.

A fix to remove the default to full sync is [in progress](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/427)
is being actively worked on.

#### Error full syncing with pruning

- Error syncing with mainnet on Besu 1.3.7 node - MerkleTrieException [\#BESU-160](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BESU-160)
The associated error is `Unable to load trie node value for hash` and is caused by the combination of
full sync and pruning.

Workarounds:
1. Explicitly disable pruning using `--pruning-enabled=false` when using fast sync.
2. If the `MerkleTrieException` occurs, delete the database and resync.

A fix for this issue is being actively worked on.

#### Bootnodes must be validators when using onchain permissioning

- Onchain permissioning nodes can't peer when using a non-validator bootnode [\#BESU-181](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BESU-181)

Workaround -> When using onchain permissioning, ensure bootnodes are also validators.

## 1.4.1

### Additions and Improvements

- Added priv_getCode [\#250](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/408). Gets the bytecode associated with a private address.
- Added `trace_transaction` JSON RPC API [\#441](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/441)
- Removed -X unstable prefix for pruning options (`--pruning-blocks-retained`, `--pruning-block-confirmations`) [\#440](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/440)
- Implemented [ECIP-1088](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1088): Phoenix EVM and Protocol upgrades. [\#434](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/434)

### Bug Fixes

- [BESU-25](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BESU-25) Use v5 Devp2p when pinging [\#392](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/392)
- Fixed a bug to manage concurrent access to cache files [\#438](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/438)
- Fixed configuration file bug: `pruning-blocks-retained` now accepts an integer in the config [\#440](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/440)
- Specifying RPC credentials file should not force RPC Authentication to be enabled [\#454](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/454)
- Enhanced estimateGas messages [\#436](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/436). When a estimateGas request fails a validation check, an improved error message is returned in the response.

### Early Access Features

Early access features are available features that are not recommended for production networks and may
have unstable interfaces.

* [Onchain privacy groups](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Concepts/Privacy/Onchain-PrivacyGroups/) with add and remove members.
  Not being able to to re-add a member to an onchain privacy group is a [known issue](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/455)
  with the add and remove functionality.

### Known Issues

#### Fast sync defaulting to full sync

-  When fast sync cannot find enough valid peers rapidly enough, Besu defaults to full sync.

1. To re-attempt fast syncing rather than continue full syncing, stop Besu, delete your database,
and start again.
2. When fast syncing, explicitly disable pruning using `--pruning-enabled=false` to reduce the likelihood
of encountering the pruning bug.

A fix to remove the default to full sync is [in progress](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/427)
and is planned for inclusion in v1.4.1.

#### Error full syncing with pruning

- Error syncing with mainnet on Besu 1.3.7 node - MerkleTrieException [\#BESU-160](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BESU-160)
The associated error is `Unable to load trie node value for hash` and is caused by the combination of
full sync and pruning.

Workarounds:
1. Explicitly disable pruning using `--pruning-enabled=false` when using fast sync.
2. If the `MerkleTrieException` occurs, delete the database and resync.

- Onchain permissioning nodes can't peer when using a non-validator bootnode [\#BESU-181](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BESU-181)

Workaround -> When using onchain permissioning, ensure bootnodes are also validators.

## 1.4.0

### Private State Migration

Hyperledger Besu v1.4 implements a new data structure for private state storage that is not backwards compatible.
A migration will be performed when starting v1.4 for the first time to reprocess existing private transactions
and re-create the private state data in the v1.4 format.

If you have existing private transactions, see [migration details](docs/Private-Txns-Migration.md).

### Additions and Improvements

* [TLS support](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Concepts/TLS/) to secure client and server communication.

* [Multi-tenancy](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Concepts/Privacy/Multi-Tenancy/) to enable multiple participants to use the same Besu and Orion node.

* [Plugin APIs](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Concepts/Plugins/) to enable building of Java plugins to extend Hyperledger Besu.

* Support for additional [NAT methods](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Find-and-Connect/Specifying-NAT/).

* Added [`priv_call`](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/API-Methods/#priv_call) which invokes
a private contract function locally and does not change the private state.

* Besu has moved from an internal Bytes library to the [Apache Tuweni](https://tuweni.apache.org/) Bytes library.
This includes using the library in the Plugins API interfaces. [#295](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/295) and [#215](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/215)

### Early Access Features

Early access features are available features that are not recommended for production networks and may
have unstable interfaces.

* [Reorg compatible privacy](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Concepts/Privacy/Privacy-Overview/#reorg-compatible-privacy)
to enable private transactions on networks using consensus mechanisms that fork.

* [Tracing API](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Concepts/Transactions/Trace-Types) to obtain detailed information about transaction processing.

### Bug Fixes

## 1.4.0 RC-2

### Private State Migration
Hyperledger Besu v1.4 implements a new data structure for private state storage that is not backwards compatible.
A migration will be performed when starting v1.4 for the first time to reprocess existing private transactions
and re-create the private state data in the v1.4 format.
If you have existing private transactions, see [migration details](docs/Private-Txns-Migration.md).

## 1.4.0 RC-1

### Additions and Improvements

- New`trace_replayBlockTransactions` JSON-RPC API

This can be enabled using the `--rpc-http-api TRACE` CLI flag.  There are some philosophical differences between Besu and other implementations that are outlined in [trace_rpc_apis](docs/trace_rpc_apis.md).

- Ability to automatically detect Docker NAT settings from inside the conainter.

The default NAT method (AUTO) can detect this so no user intervention is required to enable this.

- Added [Multi-tenancy](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Concepts/Privacy/Multi-Tenancy/) support which allows multiple participants to use the same Besu node for private transactions.

- Added TLS support for communication with privacy enclave

### Bug Fixes

- Private transactions are now validated before sent to the enclave [\#356](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/356)

### Known Bugs

- Error syncing with mainnet on Besu 1.3.7 node - MerkleTrieException [\#BESU-160](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BESU-160)

Workaround -> Don't enable pruning when syncing to mainnet.

- Onchain permissioning nodes can't peer when using a non-validator bootnode [\#BESU-181](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BESU-181)

Workaround -> When using onchain permissioning, ensure bootnodes are also validators.

## 1.4 Beta 3

### Additions and Improvements

- CLI option to enable TLS client auth for JSON-RPC HTTP [\#340](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/340)

Added CLI options to enable TLS client authentication and trusting client certificates:
~~~
--rpc-http-tls-client-auth-enabled - Enable TLS client authentication for the JSON-RPC HTTP service (default: false)
--rpc-http-tls-known-clients-file - Path to file containing client's certificate common name and fingerprint for client authentication.
--rpc-http-tls-ca-clients-enabled - Enable to accept clients certificate signed by a valid CA for client authentication (default: false)
~~~
If client-auth is enabled, user must either enable CA signed clients OR provide a known-clients file. An error is reported
if both CA signed clients is disabled and known-clients file is not specified.

- Stable Plugins APIs [\#346](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/346)

The `BesuEvents` service and related `data` package have been marked as a stable plugin API.

### Bug Fixes

- Return missing signers from getSignerMetrics [\#343](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/)

### Experimental Features

- Experimental support for `trace_replayBlockTransactions` - multiple PRs

Added support for the `trace_replayBlockTransactions` JSON-RPC call. To enable this API add
`TRACE` to the `rpc-http-api` options (for example,  `--rpc-http-api TRACE` on the command line).

This is not a production ready API.  There are known bugs relating to traced memory from calls and
returns, and the gas calculation reported in the flat traces does not always match up with the
correct gas calculated for consensus.

## 1.4 Beta 2

### Additions and Improvements

- Enable TLS for JSON-RPC HTTP Service [\#253](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/253)

Exposes new command line parameters to enable TLS on Ethereum JSON-RPC HTTP interface to allow clients like EthSigner to connect via TLS:
`--rpc-http-tls-enabled=true`
(Optional - Only required if `--rpc-http-enabled` is set to true) Set to `true` to enable TLS. False by default.
`--rpc-http-tls-keystore-file="/path/to/cert.pfx"`
(Must be specified if TLS is enabled) Path to PKCS12 format key store which contains server's certificate and it's private key
`--rpc-http-tls-keystore-password-file="/path/to/cert.passwd"`
(Must be specified if TLS is enabled) Path to the text file containing password for unlocking key store.
`--rpc-http-tls-known-clients-file="/path/to/rpc_tls_clients.txt"`
(Optional) Path to a plain text file containing space separated client’s certificate’s common name and its sha-256 fingerprints when
they are not signed by a known CA. The presence of this file (even empty) enables TLS client authentication. That is, the client
presents the certificate to server on TLS handshake and server establishes that the client certificate is either signed by a
proper/known CA. Otherwise, server trusts client certificate by reading the sha-256 fingerprint from known clients file specified above.

The format of the file is (as an example):
`localhost DF:65:B8:02:08:5E:91:82:0F:91:F5:1C:96:56:92:C4:1A:F6:C6:27:FD:6C:FC:31:F2:BB:90:17:22:59:5B:50`

### Bug Fixes

- TotalDifficulty is a BigInteger [\#253](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/253).
  Don't try and cast total difficulty down to a long because it will overflow long in a reasonable timeframe.

## 1.4 Beta 1

### Additions and Improvements

- Besu has moved from an internal Bytes library to the [Apache Tuweni](https://tuweni.apache.org/) Bytes library.  This includes using the library in the Plugins API interfaces. [#295](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/295) and [#215](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/215)
- Besu stops processing blocks if Orion is unavailable [\#253](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/253)
- Added priv_call [\#250](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/250).  Invokes a private contract function locally and does not change the private state.
- Support for [EIP-2124](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2124.md), which results in faster peer discovery [\#156](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/156)

## 1.3.8

### Additions and Improvements

- `admin_generateLogBloomCache` JSON-RPC API to generate a cache of the block bloombits that improves performance for log queries [\#262](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/262)

## Critical Fix in 1.3.7

1.3.7 includes a critical fix for Ethereum MainNet users and the Muir Glacier upgrade. We recommend users of Ethereum public networks
(MainNet, Ropsten, Rinkeby, and Goerli) upgrade immediately. This upgrade is also strongly recommended for users of private networks.

For more details, see [Hyperledger Besu Wiki](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Mainnet+Consensus+Bug+Identified+and+Resolved+in+Hyperledger+Besu).

## Muir Glacier Compatibility

For compatibility with Ethereum Muir Glacier upgrade, use v1.3.7 or later.

## ETC Agharta Compatibility

For compatibility with ETC Agharta upgrade, use 1.3.7 or later.

### Breaking Changes to Command Line

Breaking changes have been made to the command line options in v0.9 to improve usability. Many v0.8 command line options no longer work.

The [documentation](https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/latest/) has been updated throughout to use the changed command line options and the [command line reference](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/) documents the changed options.

## 0.8.5

Indefinitely delays the roll-out of Constantinople on Ethereum Mainnet due to a [potential security issue](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/01/15/security-alert-ethereum-constantinople-postponement/) detected.

## Additions and Improvements
- Remove Constantinople fork block [\#574](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/pantheon/pull/574)

## Technical Improvements

## 0.8.4

### Docker Image

If you have been running a node using the v0.8.3 Docker image, the node was not saving data to the
specified [data directory](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/),
or referring to the custom [configuration file](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/)
or [genesis file](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/).

To recover the node key and data directory from the Docker container:
`docker cp <container>:/opt/pantheon/key <destination_file>`
`docker cp <container>:/opt/pantheon/database <destination_directory>`

Where `container` is the name or ID of the Docker container containing the Besu node.

The container can be running or stopped when you copy the key and data directory. If your node was
fully synchronized to MainNet, the data directory will be ~2TB.

When restarting your node with the v0.8.4 Docker image:

* Save the node key in the [`key` file](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Concepts/Node-Keys/#node-private-key) in the data
    directory or specify the location using the [`--node-private-key` option](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/).
* Specify the `<destination_directory` as a [volume for the data directory](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/).

## 0.8.3

### Breaking Change to JSON RPC-API

From v0.8.3, incoming HTTP requests are only accepted from hostnames specified using the `--host-whitelist` command-line option. If not specified, the default value for `--host-whitelist` is `localhost`.

If using the URL `http://127.0.0.1` to make JSON-RPC calls, use `--host-whitelist` to specify the hostname `127.0.0.1` or update the hostname to `localhost`.

If your application publishes RPC ports, specify the hostnames when starting Besu. For example:

```bash
pantheon --host-whitelist=example.com
```

Specify `*` or `all` for `--host-whitelist` to effectively disable host protection and replicate pre-v0.8.3 behavior. This is not recommended for production code.
