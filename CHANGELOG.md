# Changelog

## 0.8.3 

### Breaking Change to JSON RPC-API 

From v0.8.3, incoming HTTP requests are only accepted from hostnames specified using the `--host-whitelist` command-line option. If not specified, the default value for `--host-whitelist` is `localhost`. 

If using the URL `http://127.0.0.1` to make JSON-RPC calls, use `--host-whitelist` to specify the hostname `127.0.0.1` or update the hostname to `localhost`. 

If your application publishes RPC ports, specify the hostnames when starting Pantheon. For example:  

```json
pantheon --host-whitelist=example.com
```
 
Specify `*` or `all` for `--host-whitelist` to effectively disable host protection and replicate pre-v0.8.3 behavior. This is not recommended for production code.
