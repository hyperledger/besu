/**
 * Represents the result format for Ethereum's 4byteTracer as specified in the Geth documentation.
 *
 * <p>The 4byteTracer collects function selectors (the first 4 bytes of call data) from all calls
 * made during transaction execution, along with the size of the supplied call data. This is useful
 * for analyzing which contract functions were invoked during a transaction.
 *
 * <p>The JSON output is a simple map where keys are in the format
 * "0x[4-byte-selector]-[calldata-size]" and values are the number of times that combination was
 * called. For example:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   "0x27dc297e-128": 1,
 *   "0x38cc4831-0": 2,
 *   "0x524f3889-96": 1
 * }
 * }</pre>
