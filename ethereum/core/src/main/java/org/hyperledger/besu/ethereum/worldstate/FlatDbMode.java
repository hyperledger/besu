/**
 * The FlatDbMode enum represents the different modes of the flat database. It has two modes:
 * PARTIAL and FULL.
 *
 * <p>- PARTIAL: Not all the leaves are present inside the flat database. The trie serves as a
 * fallback to retrieve missing data. The PARTIAL mode is primarily used for backward compatibility
 * purposes, where the flat database may not have all the required data, and the trie is utilized to
 * fill in the gaps.
 *
 * <p>- FULL: The flat database contains the complete representation of the world state, and there
 * is no need for a fallback mechanism. The FULL mode represents a fully synchronized state where
 * the flat database encompasses all the necessary data.
