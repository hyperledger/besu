/**
 * A {@link PathBasedDiffValue} used during state transitions to represent values that exist in the
 * Patricia Merkle Trie (PMT), but are not yet present in the Verkle trie.
 *
 * <p>This class is used in migration or hybrid scenarios where data may be read from the PMT, but
 * must be written to the Verkle trie if it changes. Although a {@code prior} value is provided
 * (from PMT), it is treated as {@code null} from the Verkle perspective, since the key did not yet
 * exist there.
 *
 * <p>In practice:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #isUnchanged()} uses the actual {@code prior} to detect whether the value changed.
 *   <li>{@link #getPrior()} returns {@code null} to indicate that the value did not exist in
 *       Verkle.
 * </ul>
