/**
 * An output used to encode data in RLP encoding.
 *
 * <p>An RLP "value" is fundamentally an {@code Item} defined the following way:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Item ::= List | Bytes
 *   List ::= [ Item, ... , Item ]
 *   Bytes ::= a binary value (comprised of an arbitrary number of bytes).
 * </pre>
 *
 * In other words, RLP encodes binary data organized in arbitrary nested lists.
 *
 * <p>A {@link RLPOutput} thus provides methods to write both lists and binary values. A list is
 * started by calling {@link #startList()} and ended by {@link #endList()}. Lists can be nested in
 * other lists in arbitrary ways. Binary values can be written directly with {@link
 * #writeBytes(Bytes)}, but the {@link RLPOutput} interface provides a wealth of convenience methods
 * to write specific types of data with a specific encoding.
 *
 * <p>Amongst the methods to write binary data, some methods are provided to write "scalar". A
 * scalar should simply be understood as a positive integer that is encoded with no leading zeros.
 * In other word, if an integer is written with a "Scalar" method variant, that number will be
 * encoded with the minimum number of bytes necessary to represent it.
 *
 * <p>The {@link RLPOutput} only defines the interface for writing data meant to be RLP encoded.
 * Getting the finally encoded output will depend on the concrete implementation, see {@link
 * BytesValueRLPOutput} for instance.
