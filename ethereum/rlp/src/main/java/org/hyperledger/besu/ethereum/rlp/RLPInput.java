/**
 * An input used to decode data in RLP encoding.
 *
 * <p>An RLP "value" is fundamentally an {@code Item} defined the following way:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Item ::= List | Bytes
 *   List ::= [ Item, ... , Item ]
 *   Bytes ::= a binary value (comprised of an arbitrary number of bytes).
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>In other words, RLP encodes binary data organized in arbitrary nested lists.
 *
 * <p>A {@link RLPInput} thus provides methods to decode both lists and binary values. A list in the
 * input is "entered" by calling {@link #enterList()} and left by calling {@link #leaveList()}.
 * Binary values can be read directly with {@link #readBytes()} ()}, but the {@link RLPInput}
 * interface provides a wealth of convenience methods to read specific types of data that are in
 * specific encoding.
 *
 * <p>Amongst the methods to read binary data, some methods are provided to read "scalar". A scalar
 * should simply be understood as a positive integer that is encoded with no leading zeros. In other
 * word, a method like {@link #readLongScalar()} does not expect an encoded value of exactly 8 bytes
 * (by opposition to {@link #readLong}), but rather one that is "up to" 8 bytes.
 *
 * @see BytesValueRLPInput for a {@link RLPInput} that decode an RLP encoded value stored in a
 *     {@link Bytes}.
